# Privacy Policy for Ctrl+Enter Sender

**Last updated: November 23, 2025**

## Overview
Ctrl+Enter Sender is a browser extension designed to prevent accidental message sending by changing keyboard behavior on chat and messaging websites. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data Collection
**Ctrl+Enter Sender does NOT collect, store, or transmit any user data.**

Specifically, we do NOT collect:
- Personal information (name, email, address, etc.)
- Authentication credentials (passwords, tokens, etc.)
- Message content or keystrokes
- Browsing history
- Location data
- Any other personal or sensitive information

## Local Storage
The extension only stores user preferences **locally in your browser** using Chrome's storage API. This data includes:
- Whether the extension is enabled or disabled for specific websites
- Custom target selectors (optional)
- Custom exclude selectors (optional)

**This data:**
- Never leaves your device
- Is not transmitted to any servers
- Is not shared with any third parties
- Can be cleared by uninstalling the extension

## Permissions Explained
The extension requires the following permissions:

### storage
Used to save your preferences locally in your browser. No data is sent to external servers.

### host_permissions (<all_urls>)
Required to intercept keyboard events (Enter and Ctrl+Enter) on any website where you might send messages. The extension cannot predict which websites you will visit, so it must be able to run on all URLs to provide consistent functionality across different chat platforms (e.g., Google Chat, Discord, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Facebook Messenger, etc.).

**Important:** Even with this permission, the extension does NOT read, collect, or transmit any content from web pages.

## Third-Party Services
This extension does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.
