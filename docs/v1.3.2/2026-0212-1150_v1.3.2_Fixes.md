## 2. Implementation Details

### Localization

Updated `_locales/ja/messages.json`:

- **Description**: Changed `onboardingDescription` to specifically mention "Enter changes to Newline".
- **Order Swap**: Swapped content of `onboardingSiteToggle` and `onboardingDefaultEnabled` so that the valid flow is presented:
  1. "Default OFF (whitelist mode) is also available."
  2. "In either mode, individual site toggle is possible."

### Styling

Updated `src/components/Onboarding.css`:

- Added `box-sizing: border-box` to `.onboarding-modal`. This ensures padding is included in the height calculation, preventing the modal from exceeding the max-height and overflowing the container.
- Reduced `max-height` from `90vh` to `80vh` to ensure it fits comfortably within the extension popup window (simulated).

## 3. Verification

- **Build**: Successful.
- **Visuals**:
  - Onboarding modal fits within popup bounds.
  - Text order is corrected.
