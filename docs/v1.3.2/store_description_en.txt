★★ Stop sending accidental "Love Letters" to your boss. ★★

Here are some completely fictional statistics that still feel emotionally accurate:

● 1 in 5 new hires gets “baptized” at work by sending an unfinished Slack/Teams message.
● 5 out of 5 people experience pure despair when ChatGPT responds to a sentence they never finished.

And then there are these… truly terrifying accidents:

【Example 1】
The "Aggressive Typo" You typed: "I will kill you" (Intended: "I will kill your ticket in the system.")

【Example 2】
The "Sudden Confession" You typed: "I love u" (Intended: "I love updates like this one.")

We’ve all been there. But we don’t have to stay there.
